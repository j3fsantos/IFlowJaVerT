%\cosette is the first symbolic analysis tool for JavaScript that precisely models the semantics of the language.
Its aim is to assist the general programmer in debugging their code: the programmer writes symbolic tests for which \cosette provides concrete counter-models.
We create \cosette following a new, general methodology for designing compositional program analyses for dynamic languages.
We prove that the symbolic execution underpinning \cosette is sound and that it does not generate false positives. Moreover, its compositionality allows us to use \cosette to find bugs specifications of JS programs that are not detectable by standard symbolic execution techniques.

%%%symbolic execution is...
%
%Symbolic testing has been successfully used to find bugs in code for 
%languages such as C, Java and JavaScript.  
%It provides stronger guarantees than the more 
%traditional concrete testing.
%Instead of concrete tests with concrete inputs, the developer uses
%symbolic tests with symbolic inputs and constraints on the output
%given by simple, intuitive  first-order assertions over
%these inputs. If the symbolic test fails, the developer obtains a
%concrete input 
%to demonstrate why it fails. 
%While key ideas behind symbolic testing  were introduced more than
%three decades ago, only recently have these techniques become
%practical as a result of significant advances in fundamental theory,
%solver technology, and scalable tool development.
%
%
%%%the problem 
%
%
%Symbolic testing provides an analysis of whole program behaviour. It
%works well for static languages such as C and Java which satisfy the
%{\em frame property}. Intuitively, the frame property states that, if
%a program produces an output when run in a given state, then it will
%produce the same output when run in an extended state. With the frame
%property, testing a C or Java program with respect to a symbolic state
%guarantees that the program will behave in the same way when the state
%is extended arbitrarily.  Symbolic testing works less well for dynamic
%languages such as JavaScript which do not satisfy the frame property.
%Without the frame property, testing a JavaScript program with respect
%to an initial symbolic state does not guarantee that the program will
%behave in the same way when the state is extended.  Such whole-program
%analysis is therefore not the best fit for JavaScript applications,
%which are commonly run in highly dynamic execution environments
% where the state can be extended  arbitrarily. 
%
%
%
%%%what is our solution: compositionality
%
%
% We introduce {\em compositional} symbolic testing for JavaScript
% programs by working with partial instrumented symbolic heaps.
% Compositionality is acheived by providing instrumentation that
% explicitly keeping track of properties that must {\em not be present}
% in a given partial heap in order for the program to behave correctly.
% The operational semantics of JavaScript over such instrumented heaps does satisfy the frame
% property.

%---------------THE OLD INTRO-----------------------

%\pmax{What is the reader supposed to learn?}

In current program analysis research, there exists a gap between bug-finding techniques and verification techniques. Bug-finding discovers concrete executions that cause a given program to behave incorrectly, emphasising precision, that is, the absence of false positives. Verification produces proofs that a given program \emph{always} behaves correctly, emphasising soundness, which mandates adherence to the language standard and  exploration of all possible paths.
%
Achieving soundness, however, is difficult and often costly, resulting in prohibitive scalability issues. In fact, most modern analysis applications, including bug-finding tools, have various intended and/or unintended sources of unsoundness~\cite{soundyPaper}.
%
%\polish{There is a growing consensus among experts that soundness is, in fact, not a necessity for most modern analysis applications~\cite{.}. Instead, the property they advocate and observe in the  majority of tools is \emph{soundiness}---maintaining soundness as much as possible, but without detrimental effects to precision and/or scalability.}

The main issue with most bug-finding tools is not that they are not sound, but that they are not \emph{trustworthy}: the extent of their soundness and precision is not formally characterised. They are usually not justified with respect to the semantics of the targeted language, often relying on unstated simplifying assumptions, if not explicitly departing from the semantics. Consequently, the fact that a bug-finding tool cannot find a bug carries no guarantees whatsoever with respect to the correctness of the input program. We trust these tools because they appear to work empirically. 

Another difference between bug-finding and verification is that bug-finding tools are very often based on whole-program analysis, whereas verification techniques are normally \emph{compositional}, meaning that the results of an analysis for a part of a program can be re-used when analysing the entire program. Compositionality is essential for tools that need to run regularly on large codebases. %For instance, it would not be possible for Infer, a bug-finding tool based on separation logic, to be part of the continuous integration system at Facebook if it were not compositional.



We present \cosette, a trustworthy, compositional symbolic execution framework for JavaScript (ECMAScript 5 Strict~\cite{ecma}) analysis. \cosette precisely follows the ES5 English standard, without introducing simplifications. 
It aims at the sweet spot between bug-finding and verification, 
%It is not done directly on JavaScript, but instead on \jsil, an intermediate representation previously introduced for JavaScript verification~\cite{javert}. \jsil comes with a trusted infrastructure that allows us to provably lift the results of symbolic analyses on compiled \jsil code back up to JavaScript. 
in that it comes with formal correctness guarantees and a \polish{result stating the precise conditions under which symbolic execution gives soundness}. We create \cosette following a new, general methodology for compositional analysis of dynamic~languages.

%Additionally, its compositionality allows us to catch a broader class of bugs than the current symbolic execution tools and also allows us to state the conditions under which the soundiness of \cosette becomes soundness, that is, when the absence of found bugs implies verification.

%However, compositionality is not trivial to achieve when the targeted programming language does not exhibit the frame property, as is the case for most dynamic languages including JavaScript.




%JavaScript is the most widespread dynamic language: it is the de facto language for client-side Web applications, used by 94.8\% of websites\footnote{\url{https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript/all/all}}; it is used for server-side scripting via Node.js; and it is even run on small embedded devices with limited memory. 
%It is the most active language in both GitHub and StackOverflow.\footnote{\url{http://githut.info}; \url{https://exploratory.io/viz/Hidetaka-Ko/94368d12800a?cb=1469037012628}}
%Due to its dynamic nature and complex semantics, JavaScript remains a difficult target for symbolic analysis and logic-based verification. 

%\pmax{Now, sth about the state-of-the-art}

% TO RELATED WORK
%Currently, several symbolic analysis tools for JavaScript are available, such as \pmaxinline{list them, cite them - are we doing static or dynamic also?}. \pmaxinline{Say something positive, don't know what, mention bug-finding}. However, there exists a gap that needs to be addressed. The symbolic analysis engines of these tools are not formalised and do not come with correctness guarantees \pmaxinline{check, especially Jalangi}. Their analyses are also not compositional \pmaxinline{We don't know what this means yet, also check, but possibly omit}. Moreover, each of these tools is tailored for catching a specific category of bugs, rather than targeting bug-finding in general \pmaxinline{give evidence - also, why do we care?}.



%We evaluate \cosette on an array of examples, including tests from the official JavaScript Test262 test suite and real-world Node.js libraries. These examples involve JavaScript-specific features, such as prototype inheritance, function closures, the for-in statement, and dynamic dispatch. We highlight the range of \cosette by using it to find bugs in a number of non-trivial separation logic specifications of JavaScript programs.



%In \S\ref{???}, we give an abstract semantics of \jsil, which we instantiate to obtain the concrete %, instrumented (discussed shortly), 
%and symbolic semantics, connected via a {\em soundness result}. Moreover, we prove that, when used for symbolic testing (discussed shortly), \cosette never produces false counter-models. 
%These theoretical results, combined with the correctness of \JSComp, allows us to lift the results of analyses done on compiled \jsil code back up to JavaScript. 

%To our knowledge, this is the first formalisation of a symbolic execution used for JavaScript analysis, and is the first symbolic execution that precisely follows the semantics of the language.
 
\myparagraph{Trustworthiness} Designing a trustworthy symbolic analysis for JavaScript and providing the appropriate correctness results is difficult, due to its complexity. The current approaches~\cite{.} normally do not give a formal account of the analysis and/or simplify the language semantics. Our approach to designing \cosette is grounded on adherence to the standard and establishing trust. 
We move the analysis to \jsil, an intermediate representation for logic-based analysis of JavaScript, which comes with a trusted compiler, \JSComp~\cite{javert}.
%, which has been extensively tested against the official test suite, Test262.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tc39/test262}} 
%and produces \jsil code that corresponds line-by-line to the standard. 
In \S\ref{sec:jsil:symb:exec}, we give a novel abstract semantics for \jsil, which we instantiate to obtain the concrete and symbolic semantics, connected via a {\em bounded soundness result}. Moreover, we prove that \cosette is precise, meaning that it never produces false positive bug reports. 
These theoretical results %, combined with the correctness of \JSComp and the fact that the memory models of JavaScript and \jsil are the same by design, 
allow us to  provably lift the results of analyses done on compiled \jsil code back up to JavaScript (\S\ref{sec:lifting}). %To our knowledge, this is the first formalisation of a symbolic execution used for JavaScript analysis, and is the first symbolic execution for JavaScript that precisely follows the semantics of the language.

\myparagraph{Compositionality} JavaScript applications are commonly run in 
highly dynamic execution environments. For instance, client-side programs dynamically load and execute third-party code as a matter of course. Therefore, it is important to be able to analyse incomplete JavaScript code in a compositional manner.
However, designing a compositional analysis for dynamic languages, such as JavaScript and \jsil, is a non-trivial task. This is because, unlike static languages, such as C, C++, and Java, dynamic languages do not observe the \emph{frame property}~\cite{?}, which is essential for compositionality. Intuitively, the frame property means that the output of a program cannot change if the state in which is run is extended. In JavaScript and \jsil, it is possible to introduce bugs extending the state in which a program is run.
%
We achieve compositionality by explicitly keeping track of properties that must {\em not be present} in a given object in order for the program to behave correctly.
%Because JavaScript does not observe the frame property, such conditions need to refer to positive resources, object properties that need to be present with certain properties, as well as negative resources, object properties that must not be present. 
Compositionality also allows us to state a verification result for \cosette, precisely capturing the conditions under which our symbolic execution is sound.
To our knowledge, \cosette is the first compositional symbolic execution tool for dynamic languages.



%
%Current symbolic execution tools for JavaScript~\cite{???} are not compositional. They assume access to the entire program, meaning that the results they obtain when analysing functions in isolation cannot be reused, as they would not account for the interaction between the function and all of its possible frames.
%
%In contrast, the symbolic execution of \cosette is compositional. This has several important benefits.
%
%First, it allows us to use function specifications instead of symbolically executing function bodies at each call site, speeding up execution time. This benefit is independent of the analysed language.
%
%Next, it allows us to catch frame bugs, which are not reachable by non-compositional symbolic execution tools. This benefit is specific to dynamic languages.
%
%Finally, it allows us to state a verification result for \cosette, precisely capturing the conditions under which our symbolic execution is sound.
%
%, meaning that once a program is analysed successfully, once can choose to re-use the results of the analysis when analysing code that calls it, also yielding a more scalable analysis.

\myparagraph{Architecture} The architecture of \cosette is shown on the right. We extend the syntax of JavaScript with constructs for creating and reasoning about symbolic values, which allow the developer to easily write assertions about the behaviour of their program. Using \JSComp, we compile the extended JS program to an extended \jsil program. The core of \cosette is a symbolic interpreter for
\jsil, whose current, proof-of-concept implementation, is done using Rosette~\cite{Rosette2,Rosette1}, a framework for the creation of symbolic interpreters. The symbolic interpreter either outputs a concrete counter-model for the given assertions, or guarantees correctness up to a given bound. %\pmaxinline{This is the first time we mention `bound'.}

%The second component that \cosette uses is \JSComp~\cite{javert}, 
%a well-tested, standard-compliant compiler from JavaScript to \jsil. We extend
%\JSComp with support for the non-strict mode of ES5, as well as
%regular expressions and the entire \jsinline|String| built-in library.
%\JSComp allows us to lift the \jsil symbolic execution to JavaScript by first compiling JavaScript code to \jsil code, and
%then symbolically executing the compiled code in the 
%\jsil symbolic interpreter. This process, described in \S\ref{symb:exec:comp},
%involves extending JavaScript syntax and the \JSComp compiler to support symbolic values and 
%constructs for reasoning about them. These constructs are intuitive
%and allow the general developer to easily write assertions about the behaviour
%of their program. 
%Moreover, we adjust the \jsil symbolic interpreter so that the abstraction level 
%of the generated \jsil code precisely matches the abstraction level of Rosette, 
% maximising the use of Rosette's native reasoning capabilities.

%dynamic languages: they feature extensible objects, dynamic property access, and dynamic function calls. In terms of separation logic, they do not have the frame property~\cite{???}. What this effectively means is that is possible to introduce bugs into a JS/\jsil program by only extending the state for which it behaved correctly. We refer to such bugs as {\em frame bugs}.  This benefit is independent of the analysed language. Second, it allows us to catch frame bugs, which are not reachable by non-compositional symbolic execution tools. This benefit is specific to dynamic languages. We achieve compositionality by keeping track of properties that we know are {\em not present} in a given object. This we describe in detail in \S\ref{???}. To our knowledge, \cosette is the first compositional symbolic execution tool for dynamic languages.


\myparagraph{Application: Symbolic Testing} 
JavaScript developers commonly obtain trust in their code by running it against ad hoc concrete test suites. 
The main drawback of this approach is that such test suites often have a high degree of uncharacterised incompleteness. % we also cant guarantee exhaustiveness 
In~\S\ref{subsec:st}, we show how \cosette can be used for systematic symbolic testing, where developers use symbolic
inputs instead of concrete inputs and state the 
constraints that the output needs to satisfy as simple, intuitive 
first-order assertions. % over these inputs. 
Then, if a test fails, \cosette provides the concrete inputs that cause it 
to fail, exposing bugs in the tested code. 
%We give a {\em proof} that \cosette does not produce false positives. 
%Moreover, the compositionality of \cosette allows us to catch bugs that are not reachable by standard symbolic execution tools.
In \S\ref{sec:evaluation}, we evaluate \cosette on challenging examples that showcase JS-specific features, as well as on real-world Node.js libraries, in which we discover several~bugs. 

\myparagraph{Application: Specification-directed Bug-finding} 
%\pmaxinline{Feeling stuck here.} 
Due to the complexity of JavaScript semantics, functional correctness 
specifications of JavaScript programs are highly intricate. 
There are only a few tools (e.g.,~\javert~\cite{javert} and KJS~\cite{Park:2015,stefanescu:oopsla:2016}) that support such expressivity. 
%They target the specialist developer wanting rich, mechanically verified specifications of critical JavaScript code.
However, when these 
tools cannot prove that a given function satisfies a specification, to discover the error, 
the developer needs to understand in detail a complicated proof trace (\javert), or  act with essentially no feedback~(KJS). In \S\ref{subsec:sdbf}, we show how \cosette can be used as an auxiliary mechanism for debugging 
separation logic specifications of JavaScript programs in \javert. 
Our approach, described in detail in \S\ref{sec:specs}, consists of translating the separation logic specifications 
into symbolic tests 
and running these tests using \cosette. 
Then, if a symbolic test generated from a given specification fails, we can 
be sure that the code to be verified does not satisfy its specification. 
More importantly, \cosette then generates a concrete witness that 
invalidates the specification. This information greatly simplifies the debugging of 
both specifications and code.

%\myparagraph{Overview} 
%In \S\ref{sec:overview}, we illustrate how \cosette can be used for symbolic testing and specification-directed debugging of JS code. In~\S\ref{sec:jsil:symb:exec}, we present our methodology for the design of program analyses for dynamic languages and give a detailed account of our symbolic execution for \jsil. Our experimental evaluation of \cosette is given in . Finally, in \S\ref{sec:rwc}, we discuss related work and give conclusions.


%\pmax{Say more clearly what the novelty is. Say in a very pretty way the connection between seplogic and non-seplogic, verification and symbolic execution, etc.}

%We highlight two relevant use cases for \cosette. First, we show how \cosette can be used as \dtag{i}~a tool for running symbolic tests for JavaScript programs; and \dtag{ii} a debugging tool for separation logic specifications of JavaScript programs.

%\myparagraph{Architecture}
%The core of \cosette consists of a symbolic interpreter for
%\jsil~\cite{javert}, a simple intermediate goto language. 
%We obtain this symbolic interpreter \emph{for free}, 
%by implementing a concrete \jsil interpreter in Rosette~\cite{Rosette2,Rosette1},~a 
%symbolic virtual machine that facilitates generation of solver-aided languages.
%We design the concrete interpreter so that all of Rosette's natively supported solver-aided features, such as advanced string and regular-expression reasoning, 
%are lifted to the \jsil symbolic interpreter. 
%In~\S\ref{sec:jsil:symb:exec}, we give a formalisation of the \jsil concrete and symbolic executions, linking them together with a {\em soundness result}. We also provide insights on how to correctly design the concrete \jsil interpreter in Rosette.

%The second component that \cosette uses is \JSComp~\cite{javert}, 
%a well-tested, standard-compliant compiler from JavaScript to \jsil. We extend
%\JSComp with support for the non-strict mode of ES5, as well as
%regular expressions and the entire \jsinline|String| built-in library.
%\JSComp allows us to lift the \jsil symbolic execution to JavaScript by first compiling JavaScript code to \jsil code, and
%then symbolically executing the compiled code in the 
%\jsil symbolic interpreter. This process, described in \S\ref{symb:exec:comp},
%involves extending JavaScript syntax and the \JSComp compiler to support symbolic values and 
%constructs for reasoning about them. These constructs are intuitive
%and allow the general developer to easily write assertions about the behaviour
%of their program. 
%Moreover, we adjust the \jsil symbolic interpreter so that the abstraction level 
%of the generated \jsil code precisely matches the abstraction level of Rosette, 
% maximising the use of Rosette's native reasoning capabilities.

%\myparagraph{Application: Symbolic Testing} A commonly used 
%approach to obtaining trust in JavaScript code is running it against 
%adhoc test batteries---verifying that given concrete inputs, the code produces the expected
%output. The main drawback of this approach is that tests, in general,
%cannot guarantee exhaustiveness. % we also cant guarantee exhaustiveness 
%In \S\ref{symbolic:testing}, we show how to use \cosette
%for symbolic testing of JavaScript code: instead of 
%tests with concrete 
%inputs, the developer uses symbolic inputs and states the 
%constraints that the output needs to satisfy as simple, intuitive 
%first-order assertions over these inputs. 
%Furthermore, if a test fails, \cosette provides the concrete inputs that cause it 
%to fail, exposing bugs in the tested code. 
%We highlight the capabilities of \cosette through examples that showcase
%challenging reasoning on strings, regular expressions, and the \jsinline|eval|
%statement.

%\myparagraph{Application: Debugging Separation Logic Specifications}
%Due to the complexity of JavaScript semantics, functional correctness 
%specifications of JS programs are highly intricate. 
%There are only a few tools (for example, \javert \cite{javert} and KJS \cite{Park:2015,stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla}) that support such expressivity. They target the specialist developer wanting rich, 
%mechanically verified specifications of critical JavaScript code.
%However, when these 
%tools cannot prove that a given function satisfies a specification, to discover the error, 
%the developer needs to understand in detail a complicated proof trace (\javert), or even act with almost no feedback~(KJS). 
%
%In \S\ref{sec:specs}, we show how \cosette can be used as an auxiliary mechanism for debugging 
%separation logic specifications of JavaScript programs in \javert. 
%Our approach consists of: translating the separation logic specifications 
%into symbolic tests 
%and running these tests using \cosette. 
%Then, if a symbolic test generated from a given specification fails, we can 
%be sure that the code to be verified does not satisfy its specification. 
%More importantly, \cosette then generates a concrete witness that 
%invalidates the specification. This information greatly simplifies the debugging of 
%both specifications and code. 

%Jilette has the following benefits: 
%
%\dtag{1} it is \emph{useful}, in that it has tangible applications:
%	it can report bugs in JavaScript programs, producing concrete witnesses that trigger these  bugs; 
%	%
%	it can be used as a helper tool for developers of logic-based functional correctness specifications of JavaScript code; 
%	%
%	and it has support for advanced string reasoning, critical for reasoning about commonly used JavaScript code;
%
%\dtag{2} it is \emph{accessible}, in that it can easily be used by a general JavaScript developer: 
%	the annotation burden of \cosette is minimal; 
%	%
%	and the assertion language is simple and intuitive;
%\dtag{3} it is \emph{trustworthy}, in that its components come with correctness guarantees: 
%	the correctness of the \JSComp compiler ensures full adherence to the real semantics of JavaScript;
%	%
%	the soundness result for the symbolic execution used in \cosette guarantees absence of false positives;
%	and \polish{sentence about unification;}
%and \dtag{4} it is \emph{extensible}, in that its coverage can easily be extended in a modular way, allowing support for: 
%	built-in libraries not covered by \JSComp; 
%	%
%	and widely used runtime libraries that are not part of the standard, such as the DOM.

%\myparagraphq{Why \cosette} 
%\cosette is \emph{useful}: it has tangible applications. 
%It can report bugs in JavaScript programs, producing concrete witnesses triggering the bugs. It can also be used as a helper tool for developers of logic-based functional correctness specifications of JavaScript code.
%\cosette is \emph{approachable}: it can easily be used by a general JavaScript developer. The annotation burden of \cosette is minimal and the assertion language is simple and intuitive. \polish{Sweet spot?}
%\cosette is \emph{trustworthy}: its components come with correctness guarantees. 
%The correctness of the \JSComp compiler ensures full adherence to the real semantics of JavaScript. The \cosette symbolic execution engine is based on a sound symbolic
%analysis for \jsil, guaranteeing the absence of false positives. \polish{Sentence about unification.}
%Finally, \cosette is \emph{extensible}: its coverage can easily be extended in a modular way. This gives us the mechanism for supporting built-in libraries not covered by \JSComp, or adding support for standard-external runtime libraries, such as the DOM.

%We show how  to use Jilette for writing symbolic tests for client side 
%JavaScript code calling Web APIs. In particular, we demonstrate how to 
%checking the conformance of Web API requests with their specified signatures. 
%The existing solutions for this problem are still imprecise due to the 
%dynamicity of JavaScript combined with the difficulty of reasoning about
%operations on symbolic strings \cite{Idontknow}. Jilette is an excellent fit for
%this task as it leverages on Rosette's back-end
%constraint solver, Z3, which supports reasoning on symbolic strings
%and regular expressions, whereas JS-2-JSIL successfully
%contains the complexity of JavaScript itself.

%
%\cite{gardner:popl:2012} have developed a separation logic for a small fragment of ECMAScript 3, to reason about the variable store emulated in the JavaScript heap.
%%
%\cite{rosu-serbanuta-2010-jlap} have developed $\mathbb{K}$, a term-rewriting framework  for  formalising the operational
%semantics of programming languages.
% In particular, they have developed KJS~\cite{Park:2015} which provides a $\mathbb{K}$-interpretation of the core language and part of the built-in libraries of the ES5 standard. KJS has been tested against the official ECMAScript Test262 test suite and passed all 2782 tests for the core language; the testing results for the built-in libraries are not reported. 
%\cite{stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla} introduce a language-independent verification infrastructure 
%that can be instantiated with a $\mathbb{K}$-interpretation of a  language to automatically generate a symbolic verification tool for that language based on the $\mathbb{K}$ reachability logic. They apply this infrastructure to KJS to generate a verification tool for JavaScript, which they use to verify functional correctness properties of operations for manipulating data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and lists.


%\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

%\pmaxinline{Can we be more general, and say something like 'logic-based specifications'? It's all about translating to FOL, or even some version of PL. Also, we need to say at some point why we care about specifications written in separation logic.}
