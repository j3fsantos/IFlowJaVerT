A parser for the pulp language (sometimes also called JS-IVL).

Sources:

The sources can be found under src/pulp_parser

Building:

sh build_pulp_parser.sh

should create a binary "ParserMain" in src/pulp_parser

Usage:

./ParserMain <program.pulp>

will output an OCaml expression constructing the programs AST.

NOTE: some example programs can be found in src/pulp_parser/test_inputs

Known Problems:

- not the entire pulp language is supported, yet.
- line numbers are not supported, yet.
