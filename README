This is a verification tool for JavaScript programs. In time it will
plug into eclipse, emacs and verification web services, to make
writing correct, fast JavaScript easier to do.

Prerequisites:

1) ocaml 3.12 or higher: http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html
   You can get this in ubuntu 11.10 and higher with:

   sudo apt-get install ocaml

2) the XML-light library: http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight
   The ubuntu install didn't work for me. I got it from the website. YMMV.

3) Java: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html 
   You can get this in ubuntu with:

   sudo apt-get install java7-jdk

4) xdot: http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot
   You can get this in ubuntu with:

   sudo apt-get install xdot

To build:

1) make init
2) $EDITOR localconfig.ml          # Set all these options so they 
   $EDITOR config/config.xml       # make sense on your system.
3) make all

If ocaml complains that you have stuff lying around that shouldn't be
there, then run "make sanitize", or just delete the _build directory.

From now on "make all" should be all you need.
