\section{Introduction}

JavaScript is the most widespread dynamic language: it is the de facto language for client-side Web
applications (used by 94.8\% of websites\footnote{w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript/all/all.});
it is used for server-side scripting via Node.js; and it is even run on small embedded devices with limited 
memory. It is the most active language in both GitHub and StackOverflow\footnote{JavaScript  has most active
 repos on GitHub, http://githut.info; JavaScript has most questions on 
 StackOverflow, \\https://exploratory.io/viz/Hidetaka-Ko/94368d12800a?cb=1469037012628.}.
The dynamic nature of JavaScript and its complex semantics make it a difficult target for
symbolic analysis and logic-based verification. 
This paper presents \jilette, a symbolic execution tool for JavaScript that improves existing solutions
in two ways: \dtag{1} it is grounded on the real semantics of the language and 
\dtag{2} it supports reasoning about symbolic strings and regular expressions. 
%
Furthermore, we present two possible uses for \jilette. It can both be used as \dtag{i} a tool for
 running symbolic tests for JavaScript programs and \dtag{ii} a debugging mechanism for separation 
 logic specifications of JavaScript programs. 

\myparagraph{Symbolic Testing} The most commonly used 
approach to obtaining trust in JavaScript code is running it against 
adhoc test batteries---given inputs, the code produces the expected
output. The main drawback of this approach is that tests, in general,
cannot guarantee exhaustiveness. We show how to use \jilette
for the symbolic testing of JavaScript programs: instead of using concrete 
inputs in tests, the developer uses symbolic inputs and states the 
constraints that the output needs to satisfy as simple, intuitive 
first-order assertions over these inputs. 
%This approach guarantees exhaustiveness.  Moreover, due to the
Furthermore, if a test fails, Jilette provides the concrete inputs that cause it 
to fail, immediately revealing bugs in the tested code.


\myparagraph{Debugging Separation Logic Specifications}
We show how to use \jilette as an auxiliary mechanism for debugging 
separation logic specifications of JavaScript programs. Verification tools for  
JavaScript code are still very rare and often require heavily annotating the 
original code for helping the solver prove entailments involving user-defined 
predicates, as well as coping with loops and recursion. Furthermore, when these 
tools cannot prove that a given function does not satisfy its specification, the 
user needs to go through a  proof trace and understand it in detail. 
Here, we demonstrate how to use \jilette to find errors in specifications by generating 
symbolic tests from these specifications and running the tests using \jilette. 
Then, if a symbolic test generated from a given specification fails, we can 
be sure that the code to be verified does not satisfy its specification. 
More importantly, in case of failure, \jilette generates a concrete counter-model that 
invalidates the specification. This information greatly simplifies the debugging of 
both specifications and code. 

\myparagraph{Architecture}
\jilette leverages on the \JSComp compiler and Rosette \cite{Rosette1}. 
\JSComp is a thoroughly tested compiler from JavaScript to \jsil, a simple 
intermediate language well suited for verification. Rosette is a 
solver-aided programming language with support for symbolic values 
and first-order assertions. The core of Jilette comprises a JSIL interpreter
written in Rosette. By piggybacking on Rosette and JS-2-JSIL, we 
are able to execute JavaScript programs on symbolic values, effectively 
obtaining a symbolic execution tool for JavaScript. 
This combination is non-trivial because \polish{many many things...} 


%We show how  to use Jilette for writing symbolic tests for client side 
%JavaScript code calling Web APIs. In particular, we demonstrate how to 
%checking the conformance of Web API requests with their specified signatures. 
%The existing solutions for this problem are still imprecise due to the 
%dynamicity of JavaScript combined with the difficulty of reasoning about
%operations on symbolic strings \cite{Idontknow}. Jilette is an excellent fit for
%this task as it leverages on Rosette's back-end
%constraint solver, Z3, which supports reasoning on symbolic strings
%and regular expressions, whereas JS-2-JSIL successfully
%contains the complexity of JavaScript itself.

\section{Related Work} 

The existing literature covers a wide range of analysis techniques for JavaScript programs, including: 
type systems~\cite{thiemann:esop:2005,anderson:ecoop:2005,jensen:sas:2009,typescript:toot:2014,feldthaus:oopsla:2014,bierman:ecoop:2014,rastogi:popl:2015},
control flow analysis~\cite{feldthaus2013efficient}, pointer analysis~\cite{jang2009points,sridharan:ecoop:12} and abstract
interpretation~\cite{kashyap:fse:14,jensen:sas:2009,andreasen:oopsla:2014,park:ecoop:15}, among others. 
Here, we focused on the existing work on logic-based analysis and symbolic execution for JavaScript. 

\myparagraph{Symbolic Execution} 




\myparagraph{Logic-based Analysis} 
%
\cite{gardner:popl:2012} have developed a separation logic for a small fragment of ECMAScript 3, to reason about the variable store emulated in the JavaScript heap.
%
\cite{rosu-serbanuta-2010-jlap} have developed $\mathbb{K}$, a term-rewriting framework  for  formalising the operational
semantics of programming languages.
 In particular, they have developed KJS~\cite{Park:2015} which provides a $\mathbb{K}$-interpretation of the core language and part of the built-in libraries of the ES5 standard. KJS has been tested against the official ECMAScript Test262 test suite and passed all 2782 tests for the core language; the testing results for the built-in libraries are not reported. 
\cite{stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla} introduce a language-independent verification infrastructure 
that can be instantiated with a $\mathbb{K}$-interpretation of a  language to automatically generate a symbolic verification tool for that language based on the $\mathbb{K}$ reachability logic. They apply this infrastructure to KJS to generate a verification tool for JavaScript, which they use to verify functional correctness properties of operations for manipulating data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and lists.
